# Semantic Release Example

This is a quick copy pastable snippet of semantic release.
Just copy the contents of this repo, and replace whatever source code you have in the src folder.
The content of the versions are stored [here(https://github.com/jeffreywu1996/semantic-release-example/blob/36ec240eb351bce5858d2422efec648076e46843/package.json#L3)]. Just change this to whatever value you want.

## How it works, workflow
1. Copy this snippet/code structure to your project and put in main branch
2. Set up github actions
3. Create PR against main branch
4. Work on PR, merge PR to main
5. github actions will trigger and automatically generate a new version and push back to main branch
